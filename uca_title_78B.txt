Utah Code Annotated § 78B-2-308(1)(c): often the abuse is compounded by the fact that the perpetrator is a member of the victim's family and when such abuse comes out, the victim is further stymied by the family's wish to avoid public embarrassment;
Utah Code Annotated § 78B-2-308(1)(d): even when the abuse is not committed by a family member, the perpetrator is rarely a stranger and, if in a position of authority, often brings pressure to bear on the victim to ensure silence;
Utah Code Annotated § 78B-2-308(1)(e): in 1992, when the Legislature enacted the statute of limitations requiring victims to sue within four years of majority, society did not understand the long-lasting effects of abuse on the victim and that it takes decades for the healing necessary for a victim to seek redress;
Utah Code Annotated § 78B-2-308(1)(f): the Legislature, as the policy-maker for the state, may take into consideration advances in medical science and understanding in revisiting policies and laws shown to be harmful to the citizens of this state rather than beneficial; and

Utah Code Annotated § 78B-2-308(4): The victim need not establish which act in a series of continuing sexual abuse incidents caused the injury complained of, but may compute the date of discovery from the date of discovery of the last act by the same perpetrator which is part of a common scheme or plan of sexual abuse.

Utah Code Annotated § 78B-3-402 Legislative findings and declarations -- Purpose of act.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Utah Code Annotated § 78B-3-402(1): The Legislature finds and declares that the number of suits and claims for damages and the amount of judgments and settlements arising from health care has increased greatly in recent years.  Because of these increases the insurance industry has substantially increased the cost of medical malpractice insurance.  The effect of increased insurance premiums and increased claims is increased health care cost, both through the health care providers passing the cost of premiums to the patient and through the provider's practicing defensive medicine because he views a patient as a potential adversary in a lawsuit.  Further, certain health care providers are discouraged from continuing to provide services because of the high cost and possible unavailability of malpractice insurance.
Utah Code Annotated § 78B-3-402(2): In view of these recent trends and with the intention of alleviating the adverse effects which these trends are producing in the public's health care system, it is necessary to protect the public interest by enacting measures designed to encourage private insurance companies to continue to provide health-related malpractice insurance while at the same time establishing a mechanism to ensure the availability of insurance in the event that it becomes unavailable from private companies.
Utah Code Annotated § 78B-3-402(3): In enacting this act, it is the purpose of the Legislature to provide a reasonable time in which actions may be commenced against health care providers while limiting that time to a specific period for which professional liability insurance premiums can be reasonably and accurately calculated; and to provide other procedural changes to expedite early evaluation and settlement of claims.

Utah Code Annotated § 78B-6-101 Title.
--------------------------------------
This part is known as the "Utah Adoption Act."

Utah Code Annotated § 78B-6-102 Legislative intent and findings -- Best interest of child -- Interests of each party.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Utah Code Annotated § 78B-6-102(1): It is the intent and desire of the Legislature that in every adoption the best interest of the child should govern and be of foremost concern in the court's determination.
Utah Code Annotated § 78B-6-102(2): The court shall make a specific finding regarding the best interest of the child, taking into consideration information provided to the court pursuant to the requirements of this chapter relating to the health, safety, and welfare of the child and the moral climate of the potential adoptive placement.
Utah Code Annotated § 78B-6-102(3): The Legislature finds that the rights and interests of all parties affected by an adoption proceeding must be considered and balanced in determining what constitutional protections and processes are necessary and appropriate.
Utah Code Annotated § 78B-6-102(4): The Legislature specifically finds that it is not in a child's best interest to be adopted by a person or persons who are cohabiting in a relationship that is not a legally valid and binding marriage under the laws of this state.  Nothing in this section limits or prohibits the court's placement of a child with a single adult who is not cohabiting or a person who is a relative of the child or a recognized placement under the Indian Child Welfare Act, 25 U.S.C. Sec. 1901 et seq.
Utah Code Annotated § 78B-6-102(5): The Legislature also finds that:
Utah Code Annotated § 78B-6-102(5)(a): the state has a compelling interest in providing stable and permanent homes for adoptive children in a prompt manner, in preventing the disruption of adoptive placements, and in holding parents accountable for meeting the needs of children;
Utah Code Annotated § 78B-6-102(5)(b): an unmarried mother, faced with the responsibility of making crucial decisions about the future of a newborn child, is entitled to privacy, and has the right to make timely and appropriate decisions regarding her future and the future of the child, and is entitled to assurance regarding the permanence of an adoptive placement;
Utah Code Annotated § 78B-6-102(5)(c): adoptive children have a right to permanence and stability in adoptive placements;
Utah Code Annotated § 78B-6-102(5)(d): adoptive parents have a constitutionally protected liberty and privacy interest in retaining custody of an adopted child;
Utah Code Annotated § 78B-6-102(5)(e): an unmarried biological father has an inchoate interest that acquires constitutional protection only when he demonstrates a timely and full commitment to the responsibilities of parenthood, both during pregnancy and upon the child's birth; and
Utah Code Annotated § 78B-6-102(5)(f): the state has a compelling interest in requiring unmarried biological fathers to demonstrate commitment by providing appropriate medical care and financial support and by establishing legal paternity, in accordance with the requirements of this chapter.
Utah Code Annotated § 78B-6-102(6): 
Utah Code Annotated § 78B-6-102(6)(a): In enacting this chapter, the Legislature has prescribed the conditions for determining whether an unmarried biological father's action is sufficiently prompt and substantial to require constitutional protection.
Utah Code Annotated § 78B-6-102(6)(b): If an unmarried biological father fails to grasp the opportunities to establish a relationship with his child that are available to him, his biological parental interest may be lost entirely, or greatly diminished in constitutional significance by his failure to timely exercise it, or by his failure to strictly comply with the available legal steps to substantiate it.
Utah Code Annotated § 78B-6-102(6)(c): A certain degree of finality is necessary in order to facilitate the state's compelling interest.  The Legislature finds that the interests of the state, the mother, the child, and the adoptive parents described in this section outweigh the interest of an unmarried biological father who does not timely grasp the opportunity to establish and demonstrate a relationship with his child in accordance with the requirements of this chapter.
Utah Code Annotated § 78B-6-102(6)(d): The Legislature finds no practical way to remove all risk of fraud or misrepresentation in adoption proceedings, and has provided a method for absolute protection of an unmarried biological father's rights by compliance with the provisions of this chapter.  In balancing the rights and interests of the state, and of all parties affected by fraud, specifically the child, the adoptive parents, and the unmarried biological father, the Legislature has determined that the unmarried biological father is in the best position to prevent or ameliorate the effects of fraud and that, therefore, the burden of fraud shall be borne by him.
Utah Code Annotated § 78B-6-102(6)(e): An unmarried biological father has the primary responsibility to protect his rights.
Utah Code Annotated § 78B-6-102(6)(f): An unmarried biological father is presumed to know that the child may be adopted without his consent unless he strictly complies with the provisions of this chapter, manifests a prompt and full commitment to his parental responsibilities, and establishes paternity.
Utah Code Annotated § 78B-6-102(7): The Legislature finds that an unmarried mother has a right of privacy with regard to her pregnancy and adoption plan, and therefore has no legal obligation to disclose the identity of an unmarried biological father prior to or during an adoption proceeding, and has no obligation to volunteer information to the court with respect to the father.
