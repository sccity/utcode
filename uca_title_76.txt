Utah Code Annotated § 76-1-304(2): If the defendant has entered into a plea agreement with the prosecution and later successfully moves to invalidate his conviction, the period of limitation is suspended from the time of the entry of the plea pursuant to the plea agreement until the time at which the conviction is determined to be invalid, and that determination becomes final.

Utah Code Annotated § 76-1-402 Separate offenses arising out of single criminal episode -- Included offenses.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Utah Code Annotated § 76-1-402(1): A defendant may be prosecuted in a single criminal action for all separate offenses arising out of a single criminal episode; however, when the same act of a defendant under a single criminal episode shall establish offenses which may be punished in different ways under different provisions of this code, the act shall be punishable under only one such provision; an acquittal or conviction and sentence under any such provision bars a prosecution under any other such provision.
Utah Code Annotated § 76-1-402(2): Whenever conduct may establish separate offenses under a single criminal episode, unless the court otherwise orders to promote justice, a defendant shall not be subject to separate trials for multiple offenses when:
Utah Code Annotated § 76-1-402(2)(a): The offenses are within the jurisdiction of a single court; and
Utah Code Annotated § 76-1-402(2)(b): The offenses are known to the prosecuting attorney at the time the defendant is arraigned on the first information or indictment.
Utah Code Annotated § 76-1-402(3): A defendant may be convicted of an offense included in the offense charged but may not be convicted of both the offense charged and the included offense. An offense is so included when:
Utah Code Annotated § 76-1-402(3)(a): It is established by proof of the same or less than all the facts required to establish the commission of the offense charged; or
Utah Code Annotated § 76-1-402(3)(b): It constitutes an attempt, solicitation, conspiracy, or form of preparation to commit the offense charged or an offense otherwise included therein; or
Utah Code Annotated § 76-1-402(3)(c): It is specifically designated by a statute as a lesser included offense.
Utah Code Annotated § 76-1-402(4): The court shall not be obligated to charge the jury with respect to an included offense unless there is a rational basis for a verdict acquitting the defendant of the offense charged and convicting him of the included offense.
Utah Code Annotated § 76-1-402(5): If the district court on motion after verdict or judgment, or an appellate court on appeal or certiorari, shall determine that there is insufficient evidence to support a conviction for the offense charged but that there is sufficient evidence to support a conviction for an included offense and the trier of fact necessarily found every fact required for conviction of that included offense, the verdict or judgment of conviction may be set aside or reversed and a judgment of conviction entered for the included offense, without necessity of a new trial, if such relief is sought by the defendant.


Utah Code Annotated § 76-1-403 Former prosecution barring subsequent prosecution for offense out of same episode.
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Utah Code Annotated § 76-1-403(1): 76-1-402(2) If a defendant has been prosecuted for one or more offenses arising out of a single criminal episode, a subsequent prosecution for the same or a different offense arising out of the same criminal episode is barred if:
Utah Code Annotated § 76-1-403(1)(a): 76-1-402(2) the subsequent prosecution is for an offense that was or should have been tried under Subsection
Utah Code Annotated § 76-1-403(1)(b): the former prosecution:
Utah Code Annotated § 76-1-403(1)(b)(i): resulted in acquittal;
Utah Code Annotated § 76-1-403(1)(b)(ii): resulted in conviction;
Utah Code Annotated § 76-1-403(1)(b)(iii): was improperly terminated; or
Utah Code Annotated § 76-1-403(1)(b)(iv): was terminated by a final order or judgment for the defendant that has not been reversed, set aside, or vacated and that necessarily required a determination inconsistent with a fact that must be established to secure conviction in the subsequent prosecution.
Utah Code Annotated § 76-1-403(2): There is an acquittal if the prosecution resulted in a finding of not guilty by the trier of facts or in a determination that there was insufficient evidence to warrant conviction.  A finding of guilty of a lesser included offense is an acquittal of the greater offense even though the conviction for the lesser included offense is subsequently reversed, set aside, or vacated.
Utah Code Annotated § 76-1-403(3): There is a conviction if the prosecution resulted in a judgment of guilt that has not been reversed, set aside, or vacated; a verdict of guilty that has not been reversed, set aside, or vacated and that is capable of supporting a judgment; or a plea of guilty accepted by the court.
Utah Code Annotated § 76-1-403(4): There is an improper termination of prosecution if the termination takes place before the verdict, is for reasons not amounting to an acquittal, and takes place after a jury has been impaneled and sworn to try the defendant, or, if the jury trial is waived, after the first witness is sworn.  However, termination of prosecution is not improper if:
Utah Code Annotated § 76-1-403(4)(a): the defendant consents to the termination;
Utah Code Annotated § 76-1-403(4)(b): the defendant waives his right to object to the termination; or
Utah Code Annotated § 76-1-403(4)(c): the court finds and states for the record that the termination is necessary because:
Utah Code Annotated § 76-1-403(4)(c)(i): it is physically impossible to proceed with the trial in conformity with the law;
Utah Code Annotated § 76-1-403(4)(c)(ii): there is a legal defect in the proceeding not attributable to the state that would make any judgment entered upon a verdict reversible as a matter of law;
Utah Code Annotated § 76-1-403(4)(c)(iii): prejudicial conduct in or out of the courtroom not attributable to the state makes it impossible to proceed with the trial without injustice to the defendant or the state;
Utah Code Annotated § 76-1-403(4)(c)(iv): the jury is unable to agree upon a verdict; or
Utah Code Annotated § 76-1-403(4)(c)(v): false statements of a juror on voir dire prevent a fair trial.


Utah Code Annotated § 76-1-404 Concurrent jurisdiction -- Prosecution in other jurisdiction barring prosecution in state.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
If a defendant's conduct establishes the commission of one or more offenses within the concurrent jurisdiction of this state and of another jurisdiction, federal or state, the prosecution in the other jurisdiction is a bar to a subsequent prosecution in this state if:Utah Code Annotated § 76-1-404(1): 76-1-403 the former prosecution resulted in an acquittal, conviction, or termination of prosecution, as those terms are defined in Section
Utah Code Annotated § 76-1-404(2): the subsequent prosecution is for the same offense or offenses.

A subsequent prosecution for an offense shall not be barred under the following circumstances:Utah Code Annotated § 76-1-405(1): The former prosecution was procured by the defendant without the knowledge of the prosecuting attorney bringing the subsequent prosecution and with intent to avoid the sentence that might otherwise be imposed; or
Utah Code Annotated § 76-1-405(2): The former prosecution resulted in a judgment of guilt held invalid in a subsequent proceeding on writ of habeas corpus, coram nobis, or similar collateral attack.


Utah Code Annotated § 76-1-501 Presumption of innocence -- "Element of the offense" defined.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Utah Code Annotated § 76-1-501(1): A defendant in a criminal proceeding is presumed to be innocent until each element of the offense charged against him is proved beyond a reasonable doubt.  In the absence of this proof, the defendant shall be acquitted.
Utah Code Annotated § 76-1-501(2): As used in this part, "element of the offense" means:
Utah Code Annotated § 76-1-501(2)(a): the conduct, attendant circumstances, or results of conduct proscribed, prohibited, or forbidden in the definition of the offense; and
Utah Code Annotated § 76-1-501(2)(b): the culpable mental state required.
Utah Code Annotated § 76-1-501(3): The existence of jurisdiction and venue are not elements of the offense but shall be established by a preponderance of the evidence.


Utah Code Annotated § 76-1-502 Negating defense by allegation or proof -- When not required.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
SectionUtah Code Annotated § 76-1-502(1): By allegation in an information, indictment, or other charge; or
Utah Code Annotated § 76-1-502(2): By proof, unless:
Utah Code Annotated § 76-1-502(2)(a): The defense is in issue in the case as a result of evidence presented at trial, either by the prosecution or the defense; or
Utah Code Annotated § 76-1-502(2)(b): The defense is an affirmative defense, and the defendant has presented evidence of such affirmative defense.


Utah Code Annotated § 76-1-503 Presumption of fact.
---------------------------------------------------
An evidentiary presumption established by this code or other penal statute has the following consequences:Utah Code Annotated § 76-1-503(1): When evidence of facts which support the presumption exist, the issue of the existence of the presumed fact must be submitted to the jury unless the court is satisfied that the evidence as a whole clearly negates the presumed fact;
Utah Code Annotated § 76-1-503(2): In submitting the issue of the existence of a presumed fact to the jury, the court shall charge that while the presumed fact must on all evidence be proved beyond a reasonable doubt, the law regards the facts giving rise to the presumption as evidence of the presumed fact.


Utah Code Annotated § 76-1-504 Affirmative defense presented by defendant.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------
Evidence of an affirmative defense as defined by this code or other statutes shall be presented by the defendant.
