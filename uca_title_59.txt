The purpose of this part is to provide general property tax relief for certain persons who own or rent their places of residence through a system of tax credits, refunds, and appropriations from the General Fund.  The relief is to offset in part the general tax burden, a significant portion of which, directly or indirectly, is represented by property tax.  Accordingly, the tax relief provided by this part is determined in part by reference to the property tax assessment and collection mechanisms, but, however, is not limited to property tax relief nor is it formulated upon the Legislature's power to relieve those taxes.  It is for the general relief of all taxes.

Utah Code Annotated § 59-12-201 Title.
--------------------------------------
This part is known as the "Local Sales and Use Tax Act."

Utah Code Annotated § 59-12-202 Purpose and intent.
---------------------------------------------------
Utah Code Annotated § 59-12-202(1): It is the purpose of this part to provide the counties, cities, and towns of the state with an added source of revenue and to thereby assist them to meet their growing financial needs.  It is the legislative intent that this added revenue be used to the greatest possible extent by the counties, cities, and towns to finance their capital outlay requirements and to service their bonded indebtedness.
Utah Code Annotated § 59-12-202(2): It is the purpose of this part to provide an orderly and efficient system of administering, operating, and enforcing the state and local option sales and use tax.  The Legislature finds that intervention by counties, cities, and towns into the administration, operation, and enforcement of the local sales and use tax, particularly in the hearing and appeal process, increases the cost of administering both the local option sales and use tax and the state sales and use tax proceedings, and substantially delays the receipt of revenues for counties, cities, towns, and the state.  The Legislature finds that the interests and concerns of counties, cities, and towns can be adequately protected through the commission's enforcement efforts.  It is therefore the Legislature's intent to grant the commission exclusive authority to administer, operate, and enforce the local option sales and use tax, without interference from counties, cities, and towns and to allow intervention by any county, city, or town only in the limited circumstances where a particular hearing or appeal may result in a significant lessening of the revenues of any single county, city, or town.

Utah Code Annotated § 59-12-701 Purpose statement.
--------------------------------------------------
The Utah Legislature finds and declares that:Utah Code Annotated § 59-12-701(1): Recreational and zoological facilities and the botanical, cultural, and zoological organizations of the state of Utah enhance the quality of life of Utah's citizens, as well as the continuing growth of Utah's tourist, convention, and recreational industries.

Utah Code Annotated § 59-12-701(5): Without jeopardizing the state's ongoing support of its recreational and zoological facilities and its botanical, cultural, and zoological organizations, the Legislature intends to permit the counties of the state of Utah to enhance public financial support of Utah's publicly owned or operated recreational and zoological facilities, and botanical, cultural, and zoological organizations owned or operated by institutions or private nonprofit organizations, through the imposition of a county sales and use tax.
Utah Code Annotated § 59-12-701(6): In a county of the first class, it is necessary and appropriate to allocate a tax imposed under this part in a manner that provides adequate predictable support to a fixed number of botanical and cultural organizations and that gives the county legislative body discretion to allocate the tax revenues to other botanical and cultural organizations.

Utah Code Annotated - Title 59 - Chapter 22 - Model Tobacco Settlement Act
**************************************************************************

Utah Code Annotated § 59-22-101 Title.
--------------------------------------
This chapter is known as the "Model Tobacco Settlement Act."

Utah Code Annotated § 59-22-201 Findings and purpose.
-----------------------------------------------------
Utah Code Annotated § 59-22-201(1): Cigarette smoking presents serious public health concerns to the State and to the citizens of the State.  The Surgeon General has determined that smoking causes lung cancer, heart disease and other serious diseases, and that there are hundreds of thousands of tobacco-related deaths in the United States each year.  These diseases most often do not appear until many years after the person in question begins smoking.
Utah Code Annotated § 59-22-201(2): Cigarette smoking also presents serious financial concerns for the State.  Under certain health-care programs, the State may have a legal obligation to provide medical assistance to eligible persons for health conditions associated with cigarette smoking, and those persons may have a legal entitlement to receive such medical assistance.
Utah Code Annotated § 59-22-201(3): Under these programs, the State pays millions of dollars each year to provide medical assistance for these persons for health conditions associated with cigarette smoking.
Utah Code Annotated § 59-22-201(4): It is the policy of the State that financial burdens imposed on the State by cigarette smoking be borne by tobacco product manufacturers rather than by the State to the extent that such manufacturers either determine to enter into a settlement with the State or are found culpable by the courts.
Utah Code Annotated § 59-22-201(5): On November 23, 1998, leading United States tobacco product manufacturers entered into a settlement agreement, entitled the "Master Settlement Agreement," with the State.  The Master Settlement Agreement obligates these manufacturers, in return for a release of past, present, and certain future claims against them as described therein, to pay substantial sums to the State (tied in part to their volume of sales); to fund a national foundation devoted to the interests of public health; and to make substantial changes in their advertising and marketing practices and corporate culture, with the intention of reducing underage smoking.
Utah Code Annotated § 59-22-201(6): It would be contrary to the policy of the State if tobacco product manufacturers who determine not to enter into such a settlement could use a resulting cost advantage to derive large, short-term profits in the years before liability may arise without ensuring that the State will have an eventual source of recovery from them if they are proven to have acted culpably.  It is thus in the interest of the State to require that such manufacturers establish a reserve fund to guarantee a source of compensation and to prevent such manufacturers from deriving large, short-term profits and then becoming judgment-proof before liability may arise.

----------------------------------------------------------
This part sets forth definitions in the Master Settlement Agreement that are cross-referenced in

Utah Code Annotated § 59-22-302 Formula for inflation adjustments.
------------------------------------------------------------------
The formula for calculating inflation adjustments, which is referenced in SubsectionUtah Code Annotated § 59-22-302(1): Any amount that, in any given year, is to be adjusted for inflation pursuant to this Exhibit, the "Base Amount," shall be adjusted upward by adding to such Base Amount the Inflation Adjustment.
Utah Code Annotated § 59-22-302(2): The Inflation Adjustment shall be calculated by multiplying the Base Amount by the Inflation Adjustment Percentage applicable in that year.
Utah Code Annotated § 59-22-302(3): The Inflation Adjustment Percentage applicable to payments due in the year 2000 shall be equal to the greater of 3% or the CPI%.  For example, if the Consumer Price Index for December 1999, as released in January 2000, is 2% higher than the Consumer Price Index for December 1998, as released in January 1999, then the CPI% with respect to a payment due in 2000 would be 2%.  The Inflation Adjustment Percentage applicable in the year 2000 would thus be 3%.
Utah Code Annotated § 59-22-302(4): (3) The Inflation Adjustment Percentage applicable to payments due in any year after 2000 shall be calculated by applying each year the greater of 3% or the CPI% on the Inflation Adjustment Percentage applicable to payments due in the prior year.  Continuing the example in subsection
Utah Code Annotated § 59-22-302(5): "Consumer Price Index" means the Consumer Price Index for All Urban Consumers as published by the Bureau of Labor Statistics of the U.S. Department of Labor, or other similar measures agreed to by the Settling States and the Participating Manufacturers.
