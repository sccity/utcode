Utah Code Annotated § 63L-11-302(1)(a): the citizens of the state are best served by applying multiple-use and sustained-yield principles in public land use planning and management; and
Utah Code Annotated § 63L-11-302(1)(b): multiple-use and sustained-yield management means that federal agencies should develop and implement management plans and make other resource-use decisions that:

Utah Code Annotated § 63L-11-302(12): management programs and initiatives that improve watersheds and forests and increase forage for the mutual benefit of wildlife species and livestock, logging, and other agricultural industries by utilizing proven techniques and tools are vital to the state's economy and the quality of life in the state;
Utah Code Annotated § 63L-11-302(13): 
Utah Code Annotated § 63L-11-302(13)(a): land management plans, programs, and initiatives should provide that the amount of domestic livestock forage, expressed in animal unit months, for permitted, active use as well as the wildlife forage included in that amount, be no less than the maximum number of animal unit months sustainable by range conditions in grazing allotments and districts, based on an on-the-ground and scientific analysis;
Utah Code Annotated § 63L-11-302(13)(b): the state opposes the relinquishment or retirement of grazing animal unit months in favor of conservation, wildlife, and other uses;
Utah Code Annotated § 63L-11-302(13)(c): the state supports the multiple-use, sustained-yield framework required by federal law for management of public lands and opposes federal prioritization of conservation as a use equal to other productive uses of public lands;

Utah Code Annotated § 63L-11-302(13)(d)(i): the state favors the best management practices that are jointly sponsored by cattlemen, sportsmen, and wildlife management groups such as chaining, logging, seeding, burning, and other direct soil and vegetation prescriptions that are demonstrated to restore forest and rangeland health, increase forage, and improve watersheds in grazing districts and allotments for the benefit of domestic livestock and wildlife;
Utah Code Annotated § 63L-11-302(13)(d)(ii): when practices described in Subsection (13)(d)(i) increase a grazing allotment's forage beyond the total permitted forage use that was allocated to that allotment in the last federal land use plan or allotment management plan still in existence as of January 1, 2005, a reasonable and fair portion of the increase in forage beyond the previously allocated total permitted use should be allocated to wildlife as recommended by a joint, evenly balanced committee of livestock and wildlife representatives that is appointed and constituted by the governor for that purpose; and
Utah Code Annotated § 63L-11-302(13)(d)(iii): the state favors quickly and effectively adjusting wildlife population goals and population census numbers in response to variations in the amount of available forage caused by drought or other climatic adjustments, and state agencies responsible for managing wildlife population goals and population census numbers will, when making those adjustments, give due regard to both the needs of the livestock industry and the need to prevent the decline of species to a point of listing under the terms of the Endangered Species Act;
Utah Code Annotated § 63L-11-302(13)(e): the state opposes the transfer of grazing animal unit months to wildlife for supposed reasons of rangeland health;
Utah Code Annotated § 63L-11-302(13)(f): reductions in domestic livestock animal unit months must be temporary and scientifically based upon rangeland conditions;
Utah Code Annotated § 63L-11-302(13)(g): policies, plans, programs, initiatives, resource management plans, and forest plans may not allow the placement of grazing animal unit months in a suspended use category unless there is a rational and scientific determination that the condition of the rangeland allotment or district in question will not sustain the animal unit months sought to be placed in suspended use;
Utah Code Annotated § 63L-11-302(13)(h): any grazing animal unit months that are placed in a suspended use category should be returned to active use when range conditions improve;
Utah Code Annotated § 63L-11-302(13)(i): policies, plans, programs, and initiatives related to vegetation management should recognize and uphold the preference for domestic grazing over alternate forage uses in established grazing districts while upholding management practices that optimize and expand forage for grazing and wildlife in conjunction with state wildlife management plans and programs in order to provide maximum available forage for all uses; and
Utah Code Annotated § 63L-11-302(13)(j): in established grazing districts, animal unit months that have been reduced due to rangeland health concerns should be restored to livestock when rangeland conditions improve, and should not be converted to wildlife use; and
Utah Code Annotated § 63L-11-302(14): 63L-8-404 a grazing allotment on federal public lands is a valid existing right for purposes of federal land withdrawals when the owner of the grazing allotment meets the requirements described in Section
