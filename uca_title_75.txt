Utah Code Annotated § 75-2-302(1)(b): (1)(b)(i) If the testator had one or more children living when he executed the will, and the will devised property or an interest in property to one or more of the then-living children, an omitted after-born or after-adopted child is entitled to share in the testator's estate as follows:

Utah Code Annotated § 75-2-401 Exempt property and allowances -- Applicable law.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
This part applies to the estate of a decedent who dies domiciled in Utah.  Rights to homestead allowance, exempt property, and family allowance for a decedent who dies not domiciled in Utah are governed by the law of the decedent's domicile at death.

Utah Code Annotated § 75-2-402 Homestead allowance.
---------------------------------------------------
A decedent's surviving spouse is entitled to a homestead allowance of $22,500.  If there is no surviving spouse, each minor child and each dependent child of the decedent is entitled to a homestead allowance amounting to $22,500 divided by the number of minor and dependent children of the decedent.  The homestead allowance is exempt from and has priority over all claims of the estate.  Unless otherwise provided by the will or governing instrument, the homestead allowance is chargeable against any benefit or share passing to the surviving spouse, minor, or dependent child, by the will of the decedent, by intestate succession, by way of elective share, and by way of nonprobate transfers as defined in Sections

Utah Code Annotated § 75-2-403 Exempt property.
-----------------------------------------------
In addition to the homestead allowance, the decedent's surviving spouse is entitled from the estate to a value, not exceeding $15,000 in excess of any security interests therein, in household furniture, automobiles, furnishings, appliances, and personal effects.  If there is no surviving spouse, the decedent's children are entitled jointly to the same value.  If encumbered chattels are selected and the value in excess of security interests, plus that of other exempt property, is less than $15,000, or if there is not $15,000 worth of exempt property in the estate, the spouse or children are entitled to other assets of the estate, if any, to the extent necessary to make up the $15,000 value.  Rights to exempt property and assets needed to make up a deficiency of exempt property have priority over all claims against the estate, but the right to any assets to make up a deficiency of exempt property abates as necessary to permit earlier payment of homestead allowance and family allowance.  Unless otherwise provided by the will or governing instrument, the exempt property allowance is chargeable against any benefit or share passing to the surviving spouse, if any, or if there is no surviving spouse, to the decedent's children, by the will of the decedent, by intestate succession, by way of elective share, and by way of nonprobate transfers as defined in Sections

Utah Code Annotated § 75-2-404 Family allowance.
------------------------------------------------
Utah Code Annotated § 75-2-404(1): In addition to the right to homestead allowance and exempt property, the decedent's surviving spouse and minor children whom the decedent was obligated to support and children who were in fact being supported by the decedent are entitled to a reasonable allowance in money out of the estate for their maintenance during the period of administration, which allowance may not continue for longer than one year if the estate is inadequate to discharge allowed claims.  The allowance may be paid as a lump sum or in periodic installments.  It is payable to the surviving spouse, if living, for the use of the surviving spouse and minor and dependent children;  otherwise to the children, or persons having their care and custody.  If a minor child or dependent child is not living with the surviving spouse, the allowance may be made partially to the child or his guardian or other person having the child's care and custody, and partially to the spouse, as their needs may appear.  The family allowance is exempt from and has priority over all claims except the homestead allowance.
Utah Code Annotated § 75-2-404(2): 75-2-205; 75-2-206 Unless otherwise provided by the will or governing instrument, the family allowance is chargeable against any benefit or share passing to the surviving spouse or minor children, by the will of the decedent, by intestate succession, by way of elective share, and by way of nonprobate transfers as defined in Sections


Utah Code Annotated § 75-2-405 Source, determination, and documentation.
------------------------------------------------------------------------
Utah Code Annotated § 75-2-405(1): If the estate is otherwise sufficient, property specifically devised may not be used to satisfy rights to homestead allowance or exempt property.  Subject to this restriction, the surviving spouse, guardians of minor children, or children who are adults may select property of the estate as homestead allowance and exempt property.  The personal representative may make those selections if the surviving spouse, the children, or the guardians of the minor children are unable or fail to do so within a reasonable time or there is no guardian of a minor child.  The personal representative may execute an instrument or deed of distribution to establish the ownership of property taken as homestead allowance or exempt property.  The personal representative may determine the family allowance in a lump sum not exceeding $27,000 or periodic installments not exceeding $2,250 per month for one year, and may disburse funds of the estate in payment of the family allowance and any part of the homestead allowance payable in cash.  The personal representative or an interested person aggrieved by any selection, determination, payment, proposed payment, or failure to act under this section may petition the court for appropriate relief, which may include a family allowance other than that which the personal representative determined or could have determined.
Utah Code Annotated § 75-2-405(2): 75-2-212(2) If the right to an elective share is exercised on behalf of a surviving spouse who is an incapacitated person, the personal representative may add any unexpended portions payable under the homestead allowance, exempt property, and family allowance to the trust established under Subsection

Utah Code Annotated § 75-2-507 Revocation by writing or by act.
---------------------------------------------------------------
Utah Code Annotated § 75-2-507(1): A will or any part thereof is revoked:
Utah Code Annotated § 75-2-507(1)(a): by executing a subsequent will that revokes the previous will or part expressly or by inconsistency;  or
Utah Code Annotated § 75-2-507(1)(b): by performing a revocatory act on the will, if the testator performed the act with the intent and for the purpose of revoking the will or part or if another individual performed the act in the testator's conscious presence and by the testator's direction.  For purposes of this subsection, "revocatory act on the will" includes burning, tearing, canceling, obliterating, or destroying the will or any part of it.  A burning, tearing, or canceling is a "revocatory act on the will," whether or not the burn, tear, or cancellation touched any of the words on the will.
Utah Code Annotated § 75-2-507(2): If a subsequent will does not expressly revoke a previous will, the execution of the subsequent will wholly revokes the previous will by inconsistency if the testator intended the subsequent will to replace rather than supplement the previous will.
Utah Code Annotated § 75-2-507(3): The testator is presumed to have intended a subsequent will to replace rather than supplement a previous will if the subsequent will makes a complete disposition of the testator's estate.  If this presumption arises and is not rebutted by clear and convincing evidence, the previous will is revoked;  only the subsequent will is operative on the testator's death.
Utah Code Annotated § 75-2-507(4): The testator is presumed to have intended a subsequent will to supplement rather than replace a previous will if the subsequent will does not make a complete disposition of the testator's estate.  If this presumption arises and is not rebutted by clear and convincing evidence, the subsequent will revokes the previous will only to the extent the subsequent will is inconsistent with the previous will;  each will is fully operative on the testator's death to the extent they are not inconsistent.


Utah Code Annotated § 75-2-508 Revocation by change of circumstances.
---------------------------------------------------------------------
Except as provided in Sections

Utah Code Annotated § 75-2-509 Revival of revoked will.

The devise is not invalid because the trust is amendable or revocable, or because the trust was amended after the execution of the will or the testator's death.
Utah Code Annotated § 75-2-511(2): (1) Unless the testator's will provides otherwise, property devised to a trust described in Subsection
Utah Code Annotated § 75-2-511(3): Unless the testator's will provides otherwise, a revocation or termination of the trust before the testator's death causes the devise to lapse.

Utah Code Annotated § 75-2-514(1)(c): a writing signed by the decedent evidencing the contract.

Utah Code Annotated § 75-2-702(4)(c): 75-2-1203; 75-2-1203 the imposition of a 120-hour requirement of survival would cause a nonvested property interest or a power of appointment to fail to qualify for validity under Section
Utah Code Annotated § 75-2-702(4)(d): the application of a 120-hour requirement of survival to multiple governing instruments would result in an unintended failure or duplication of a disposition; but survival shall be established by clear and convincing evidence.

Utah Code Annotated § 75-2-708 Class gifts to "descendants," "issue," or "heirs of the body" -- Form of distribution if none specified.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
If a class gift in favor of "descendants," "issue," or "heirs of the body" does not specify the manner in which the property is to be distributed among the class members, the property is distributed among the class members who are living when the interest is to take effect in possession or enjoyment, in such shares as they would receive, under the applicable law of intestate succession, if the designated ancestor had then died intestate owning the subject matter of the class gift.

Utah Code Annotated § 75-2-709(2)(a): surviving descendants in the generation nearest to the designated ancestor which contains one or more surviving descendants; and
Utah Code Annotated § 75-2-709(2)(b): deceased descendants in the same generation who left surviving descendants, if any.  Each surviving descendant in the nearest generation is allocated one share.  The remaining shares, if any, are combined and then divided in the same manner among the surviving descendants of the deceased descendants as if the surviving descendants who were allocated a share and their surviving descendants had predeceased the distribution date.

Utah Code Annotated § 75-2-710 Worthier-title doctrine abolished.

Language in a governing instrument describing the beneficiaries of a disposition as the transferor's "heirs," "heirs-at-law," "next-of-kin," "distributees," "relatives," or "family," or language of similar import, does not create or presumptively create a reversionary interest in the transferor.

Utah Code Annotated § 75-2-711 Interests in "heirs" and like.
-------------------------------------------------------------
If an applicable statute or a governing instrument calls for a present or future distribution to or creates a present or future interest in a designated individual's "heirs," "heirs-at-law," "next-of-kin," "relatives," or "family," or language of similar import, the property passes to those persons, including the state, and in such shares as would succeed to the designated individual's intestate estate under the intestate succession law of the designated individual's domicile if the designated individual died when the disposition is to take effect in possession or enjoyment.  If the designated individual's surviving spouse is living but is remarried at the time the disposition is to take effect in possession or enjoyment, the surviving spouse is not an heir of the designated individual.

Utah Code Annotated § 75-2-801(2)(a)(ii): The disclaimer shall be filed in a court with jurisdiction under Title 78A, Judiciary and Judicial Administration.
Utah Code Annotated § 75-2-801(2)(a)(iii): Notwithstanding Title 78B, Chapter 3a, Venue for Civil Actions, a person shall bring an action described in Subsection (2)(a) in the county in which proceedings for the administration of the estate of the deceased owner or deceased donee of the power have been commenced if the action is brought in the district court.
Utah Code Annotated § 75-2-801(2)(a)(iv): A copy of the disclaimer shall be delivered in person or mailed by registered or certified mail, return receipt requested, to any personal representative or other fiduciary of the decedent or donee of the power.
Utah Code Annotated § 75-2-801(2)(b): If a property or interest has devolved to the disclaimant under a nontestamentary instrument or contract, the disclaimer shall be delivered or filed, if of a present interest, not later than nine months after the effective date of the nontestamentary instrument or contract and, if of a future interest, not later than nine months after the event determining that the taker of the property or interest is finally ascertained and his interest is indefeasibly vested.  If the person entitled to disclaim does not know of the existence of the interest, the disclaimer shall be delivered or filed not later than nine months after the person learns of the existence of the interest.  The effective date of a revocable instrument or contract is the date on which the maker no longer has power to revoke it or to transfer to the maker or another the entire legal and equitable ownership of the interest.

A future interest that takes effect in possession or enjoyment after the termination of the estate or interest disclaimed takes effect as if the disclaimant had predeceased the decedent.

A disclaimer relates back for all purposes to that date.  A future interest that takes effect in possession or enjoyment at or after the termination of the disclaimed interest takes effect as if the disclaimant had died before the effective date of the instrument or contract that transferred the disclaimed interest.
Utah Code Annotated § 75-2-801(4)(c): The disclaimer or the written waiver of the right to disclaim is binding upon the disclaimant or person waiving and all persons claiming through or under either of them.
Utah Code Annotated § 75-2-801(5): The right to disclaim property or an interest therein is barred by:

----------------------------------------------------
Supervised administration is a single in rem proceeding to secure complete administration and settlement of a decedent's estate under the continuing authority of the court which extends until entry of an order approving distribution of the estate and discharging the personal representative or other order terminating the proceeding. A supervised personal representative is responsible to the court, as well as to the interested parties, and is subject to directions concerning the estate made by the court on its own motion or on the motion of any interested party. Except as otherwise provided in this part, or as otherwise ordered by the court, a supervised personal representative has the same duties and powers as a personal representative who is not supervised.

Utah Code Annotated § 75-3-502 Petition -- Order.
-------------------------------------------------
A petition for supervised administration may be filed by any interested person or by a personal representative at any time or the prayer for supervised administration may be joined with a petition in a testacy or appointment proceeding.  If the testacy of the decedent and the priority and qualification of any personal representative have not been adjudicated previously, the petition for supervised administration shall include the matters required of a petition in a formal testacy proceeding and the notice requirements and procedures applicable to a formal testacy proceeding apply.  If not previously adjudicated, the court shall adjudicate the testacy of the decedent and questions relating to the priority and qualifications of the personal representative in any case involving a request for supervised administration, even though the request for supervised administration may be denied.  After notice to interested persons, the court shall order supervised administration of a decedent's estate:Utah Code Annotated § 75-3-502(1): If the decedent's will directs supervised administration, it shall be ordered unless the court finds that circumstances bearing on the need for supervised administration have changed since the execution of the will and that there is no necessity for supervised administration.

Unless restricted by the court, a supervised personal representative has, without interim orders approving exercise of a power, all powers of personal representatives under this code, but he shall not exercise his power to make any distribution of the estate without prior order of the court. Any other restriction on the power of a personal representative which may be ordered by the court must be endorsed on his letters of appointment and, unless so endorsed, is ineffective as to persons dealing in good faith with the personal representative.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Within three months after his appointment, a personal representative, who is not a special administrator or a successor to another representative who has previously discharged this duty, shall prepare an inventory of property owned by the decedent at the time of his death, listing it with reasonable detail, and indicating as to each listed item, its fair market value as of the date of the decedent's death, and the type and amount of any encumbrance that may exist with reference to any item. The personal representative shall send a copy of the inventory to interested persons who request it. He may also file the original of the inventory with the court.

Utah Code Annotated § 75-3-706 Employment of appraisers.
--------------------------------------------------------
The personal representative may employ a qualified and disinterested appraiser to assist him in ascertaining the fair market value as of the date of the decedent's death of any asset the value of which may be subject to reasonable doubt. Different persons may be employed to appraise different kinds of assets included in the estate. The names and addresses of any appraiser shall be indicated on the inventory with the item or items he appraised.

Utah Code Annotated § 75-3-707 Duty of personal representative -- Supplementary inventory.
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
If any property not included in the original inventory comes to the knowledge of a personal representative or if the personal representative learns that the value or description indicated in the original inventory for any item is erroneous or misleading, he shall make a supplementary inventory or appraisement showing the market value as of the date of the decedent's death of the new item or the revised market value or descriptions, and the appraisers or other data relied upon, if any, and file it with the court if the original inventory was filed, or furnish copies thereof or information thereof to persons interested in the new information.

The request by a personal representative for delivery of any property possessed by an heir or devisee is conclusive evidence, in any action against the heir or devisee for possession thereof, that the possession of the property by the personal representative is necessary for purposes of administration. The personal representative shall pay taxes on, and take all steps reasonably necessary for the management, protection, and preservation of, the estate in his possession. He may maintain an action to recover possession of property or to determine the title thereto.

Utah Code Annotated § 75-3-709 Power to avoid transfers.

The property liable for the payment of unsecured debts of a decedent includes all property transferred by him by any means which is in law void or voidable as against his creditors, and subject to prior liens, the right to recover this property, so far as necessary for the payment of unsecured debts of the decedent, is exclusively in the personal representative. The personal representative is not required to institute such an action unless requested by creditors who must pay or secure the cost and expenses of litigation.

Utah Code Annotated § 75-3-710 Powers of personal representatives -- In general.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Until termination of his appointment a personal representative has the same power over the title to property of the estate that an absolute owner would have, in trust, however, for the benefit of the creditors and others interested in the estate. This power may be exercised without notice, hearing, or order of court, unless otherwise specifically provided by this code.

Utah Code Annotated § 75-3-711 Improper exercise of power -- Breach of fiduciary duty.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
If the exercise of power concerning the estate is improper, the personal representative is liable to interested persons for damage or loss resulting from breach of his fiduciary duty to the same extent as a trustee of an express trust.  The rights of purchasers and others dealing with a personal representative shall be determined as provided in Sections

Utah Code Annotated § 75-3-712 Sale, encumbrance or transaction involving conflict of interest -- Voidable -- Exceptions.

Utah Code Annotated § 75-3-712(2): The transaction is approved by the court after notice to interested persons.


Utah Code Annotated § 75-3-713 Persons dealing with personal representative -- Protection.
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
A person who in good faith either assists a personal representative or deals with him for value is protected as if the personal representative properly exercised his power. The fact that a person knowingly deals with a personal representative does not alone require the person to inquire into the existence of a power or the propriety of its exercise. Except for restrictions on powers of supervised personal representatives which are endorsed on letters as provided in Section

Utah Code Annotated § 75-3-714 Transactions authorized for personal representatives -- Exceptions.

If a preference or security in regard to a claim is allowed in another jurisdiction but not in this state, the creditor so benefited is to receive dividends from local assets only upon the balance of his claim after deducting the amount of the benefit.
Utah Code Annotated § 75-3-815(3): In case the family exemptions and allowances, prior charges and claims of the entire estate exceed the total value of the portions of the estate being administered separately and this state is not the state of the decedent's last domicile, the claims allowed in this state shall be paid their proportion if local assets are adequate for the purpose, and the balance of local assets shall be transferred to the domiciliary personal representative. If local assets are not sufficient to pay all claims allowed in this state the amount to which they are entitled, local assets shall be marshalled so that each claim allowed in this state is paid its proportion as far as possible, after taking into account all dividends on claims allowed in this state from assets in other jurisdictions.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Utah Code Annotated § 75-3-816(1): 75-3-1001 The estate of a nonresident decedent being administered by a personal representative appointed in this state shall, if there is a personal representative of the decedent's domicile willing to receive it, be distributed to the domiciliary personal representative for the benefit of the successors of the decedent unless:
Utah Code Annotated § 75-3-816(1)(a): By virtue of the decedent's will, if any, and applicable choice of law rules, the successors are identified pursuant to the local law of this state without reference to the local law of the decedent's domicile;
Utah Code Annotated § 75-3-816(1)(b): The personal representative of this state, after reasonable inquiry, is unaware of the existence or identity of a domiciliary personal representative; or

Utah Code Annotated § 75-3-901 Successors' rights if no administration.
-----------------------------------------------------------------------
In the absence of administration, the heirs and devisees are entitled to the estate in accordance with the terms of a probated will or the laws of intestate succession. Devisees may establish title by the probated will to devised property. Persons entitled to property by homestead allowance, exemption, or intestacy may establish title thereto by proof of the decedent's ownership, his death, and their relationship to the decedent. Successors take subject to all charges incident to administration, including the claims of creditors and allowances of surviving spouse and dependent children, and subject to the rights of others resulting from abatement, retainer, advancement, and ademption.

Utah Code Annotated § 75-3-902 Distribution -- Order in which assets appropriated -- Abatement.

Utah Code Annotated § 75-3-902(1)(d): specific devises.
Utah Code Annotated § 75-3-902(2): For purposes of abatement, a general devise charged on any specific property or fund is a specific devise to the extent of the value of the property on which it is charged, and upon the failure or insufficiency of the property on which it is charged, a general devise to the extent of the failure or insufficiency.  Abatement within each classification is in proportion to the amounts of property each of the beneficiaries would have received if full distribution of the property had been made in accordance with the terms of the will.
Utah Code Annotated § 75-3-902(3): (1) If the will expresses an order of abatement, or if the testamentary plan or the express or implied purpose of the devise would be defeated by the order of abatement stated in Subsection
Utah Code Annotated § 75-3-902(4): If the subject of a preferred devise is sold or used incident to administration, abatement shall be achieved by appropriate adjustments in, or contribution from, other interests in the remaining assets.


Utah Code Annotated § 75-3-903 Right of retainer.
-------------------------------------------------
The amount of a noncontingent indebtedness of a successor to the estate if due, or its present value if not due, shall be offset against the successor's interest; but the successor has the benefit of any defense which would be available to him in a direct proceeding for recovery of the debt.

Utah Code Annotated § 75-3-904 Interest on general pecuniary devise.
--------------------------------------------------------------------
General pecuniary devises bear interest at the legal rate beginning one year after the first appointment of a personal representative until payment, unless a contrary intent is indicated by the will.

Utah Code Annotated § 75-3-905 Penalty clause for contest.
----------------------------------------------------------
A provision in a will purporting to penalize any interested person for contesting the will or instituting other proceedings relating to the estate is unenforceable if probable cause exists for instituting proceedings.

Utah Code Annotated § 75-3-906 Distribution in kind -- Valuation -- Method.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
Utah Code Annotated § 75-3-906(1): 75-2-403; (1)(b) Unless a contrary intention is indicated by the will, the distributable assets of a decedent's estate shall be distributed in kind to the extent possible through application of the following provisions:
Utah Code Annotated § 75-3-906(1)(a): 75-2-403 A specific devisee is entitled to distribution of the thing devised to him, and a spouse or child who has selected particular assets of an estate as provided in Section
Utah Code Annotated § 75-3-906(1)(b): Any homestead or family allowance or devise payable in money may be satisfied by value in kind provided:
Utah Code Annotated § 75-3-906(1)(b)(i): the person entitled to the payment has not demanded payment in cash;
Utah Code Annotated § 75-3-906(1)(b)(ii): the property distributed in kind is valued at fair market value as of the date of its distribution; and
Utah Code Annotated § 75-3-906(1)(b)(iii): no residuary devisee has requested that the asset in question remain a part of the residue of the estate.
Utah Code Annotated § 75-3-906(1)(c): (1)(b) For the purpose of valuation under Subsection
Utah Code Annotated § 75-3-906(1)(d): The residuary estate shall be distributed in kind if there is no objection to the proposed distribution and it is practicable to distribute undivided interests. In other cases, residuary property may be converted into cash for distribution.
Utah Code Annotated § 75-3-906(2): After the probable charges against the estate are known, the personal representative may mail or deliver a proposal for distribution to all persons who have a right to object to the proposed distribution. The right of any distributee to object to the proposed distribution on the basis of the kind or value of asset he is to receive, if not waived earlier in writing, terminates if he fails to object in writing received by the personal representative within 30 days after mailing or delivery of the proposal.


Utah Code Annotated § 75-3-907 Distribution in kind -- Evidence.
----------------------------------------------------------------
If distribution in kind is made, the personal representative shall execute an instrument or deed of distribution assigning, transferring, or releasing the assets to the distributee as evidence of the distributee's title to the property.

Utah Code Annotated § 75-3-908 Distribution -- Right or title of distributee.
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
Proof that a distributee has received an instrument or deed of distribution of assets in kind, or payment in distribution, from a personal representative, is conclusive evidence that the distributee has succeeded to the interest of the estate in the distributed assets, as against all persons interested in the estate, except that the personal representative may recover the assets or their value if the distribution was improper.

Utah Code Annotated § 75-3-909 Improper distribution -- Liability of distributee.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Unless the distribution or payment no longer can be questioned because of adjudication, estoppel, or limitation, a distributee of property improperly distributed or paid, or a claimant who was improperly paid, is liable to return the property improperly received and its income since distribution if he has the property. If he does not have the property, then he is liable to return the value as of the date of disposition of the property improperly received and its income and gain received by him.

Utah Code Annotated § 75-3-910 Purchasers from distributees protected.
----------------------------------------------------------------------
If property distributed in kind or a security interest therein is acquired for value in good faith and without notice of any adverse claim by a purchaser from or lender to a distributee who has received an instrument or deed of distribution from the personal representative, or is so acquired by a purchaser from or lender to a transferee from the distributee, the purchaser or lender takes title free of rights of any interested person in the estate and incurs no personal liability to the estate, or to any interested person, whether or not the distribution was proper or supported by court order or the authority of the personal representative was terminated before execution of the instrument or deed. This section protects a purchaser from or lender to a distributee who, as personal representative, has executed a deed of distribution to himself, as well as a purchaser from or lender to any other distributee or his transferee. To be protected under this section, a purchaser or lender need not inquire whether a personal representative acted properly in making the distribution in kind, even if the personal representative and the distributee are the same person, or whether the authority of the personal representative had terminated before the distribution.

Utah Code Annotated § 75-3-911 Partition for purpose of distribution.
---------------------------------------------------------------------
When two or more heirs or devisees are entitled to distribution of undivided interests in any real or personal property of the estate, the personal representative or one or more of the heirs or devisees may petition the court, prior to the formal or informal closing of the estate, to make partition. After notice to the interested heirs or devisees, the court shall partition the property in the same manner as provided by the law for civil actions of partition. The court may direct the personal representative to sell any property which cannot be partitioned without prejudice to the owners and which cannot conveniently be allotted to any one party.

Utah Code Annotated § 75-3-912 Private agreements among successors to decedent binding on personal representative.
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Subject to the rights of creditors and taxing authorities, competent successors may agree among themselves to alter the interests, shares, or amounts to which they are entitled under the will of the decedent, or under the laws of intestacy, in any way that they provide in a written contract executed by all who are affected by its provisions. The personal representative shall abide by the terms of the agreement, subject to his obligation to administer the estate for the benefit of creditors, to pay all taxes and costs of administration, and to carry out the responsibilities of his office for the benefit of any successors of the decedent who are not parties. Personal representatives of decedents' estates are not required to see to the performance of trusts if the trustee thereof is another person who is willing to accept the trust. Accordingly, trustees of a testamentary trust are successors for the purposes of this section. Nothing contained in this section relieves trustees of any duties owed to beneficiaries of trusts.

Utah Code Annotated § 75-3-913 Distributions to trustee.
--------------------------------------------------------
Utah Code Annotated § 75-3-913(1): 75-7-811 Before distributing to a trustee, the personal representative may require that the trust be registered if the state in which it is to be administered provides for registration and that the trustee inform the qualified beneficiaries as provided in Section
Utah Code Annotated § 75-3-913(2): If the trust instrument does not excuse the trustee from giving bond, the personal representative may petition the appropriate court to require that the trustee post bond if he apprehends that distribution might jeopardize the interests of persons who are not able to protect themselves; and he may withhold distribution until the court has acted.
Utah Code Annotated § 75-3-913(3): (1); (2) No inference of negligence on the part of the personal representative shall be drawn from his failure to exercise the authority conferred by Subsections


Utah Code Annotated § 75-3-914 Disposition of unclaimed assets.
---------------------------------------------------------------
Utah Code Annotated § 75-3-914(1): If an heir, devisee or claimant cannot be found, the personal representative shall distribute the share of the missing person to his conservator, if any, but otherwise to the state treasurer for the benefit of the state school fund.
Utah Code Annotated § 75-3-914(2): The money received by the state treasurer shall be paid to the person entitled on proof of his right to it or, if the state treasurer refuses or fails to pay, the person may petition the court which appointed the personal representative, whereupon the court upon notice to the state treasurer may determine the person entitled to the money and order the treasurer to pay it to him. No interest is allowed thereon, and the heir, devisee, or claimant shall pay all costs and expenses incident to the proceeding.


Utah Code Annotated § 75-3-915 Distribution to person under disability.
-----------------------------------------------------------------------
A personal representative may discharge his obligation to distribute to any person under legal disability by distributing to his conservator, or any other person authorized by this code or otherwise to give a valid receipt and discharge for the distribution.

Utah Code Annotated § 75-3-916 Apportionment of estate taxes.
-------------------------------------------------------------
Utah Code Annotated § 75-3-916(1): As used in this section:
Utah Code Annotated § 75-3-916(1)(a): "Estate" means the gross estate of a decedent as determined for the purpose of federal estate tax and the estate tax payable to this state;
Utah Code Annotated § 75-3-916(1)(b): "Fiduciary" means personal representative, executor, administrator of any description, or trustee;
Utah Code Annotated § 75-3-916(1)(c): "Person" means any individual, partnership, association, joint stock company, corporation, government, political subdivision, governmental agency, or local governmental agency;
Utah Code Annotated § 75-3-916(1)(d): "Person interested in the estate" means any person, including a personal representative, conservator, guardian, or trustee entitled to receive, or who has received, from a decedent while alive or by reason of the death of a decedent any property or interest in property included in the decedent's taxable estate;
Utah Code Annotated § 75-3-916(1)(e): "State" means any state, territory, or possession of the United States, the District of Columbia, or the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico; and
Utah Code Annotated § 75-3-916(1)(f): "Tax" means the federal estate tax and the inheritance, estate, or other death tax payable to this state and interest and penalties imposed in addition to the tax but specifically does not include the federal generation skipping transfer tax.
Utah Code Annotated § 75-3-916(2): Unless otherwise provided in the will or other dispositive instrument, the tax shall be apportioned among all persons interested in the estate. The apportionment shall be made in the proportion that the value of the interest of each person interested in the estate bears to the total value of the interests of all persons interested in the estate. The values used in determining the tax shall be used for that purpose. If the decedent's will or other dispositive instrument directs a method of apportionment of tax different from the method described in this code, the method described in the will or other dispositive instrument controls.
Utah Code Annotated § 75-3-916(3): (2); (2); (2)
Utah Code Annotated § 75-3-916(3)(a): The court having jurisdiction over the administration of the estate of a decedent shall determine the apportionment of the tax. If there are no probate proceedings, the court of the county in which the decedent was domiciled at death shall determine the apportionment of the tax upon the petition of the person required to pay the tax.
Utah Code Annotated § 75-3-916(3)(b): (2) If the court finds that it is inequitable to apportion interest and penalties in the manner provided in Subsection
Utah Code Annotated § 75-3-916(3)(c): (2); (2) The expenses reasonably incurred by any fiduciary and by other persons interested in the estate concerning the determination of the amount and apportionment of the tax shall be apportioned as provided in Subsection
Utah Code Annotated § 75-3-916(3)(d): If the court finds that the assessment of penalties and interest assessed in relation to the tax is due to delay caused by the negligence of the fiduciary, the court may charge the fiduciary with the amount of the assessed penalties and interest.
Utah Code Annotated § 75-3-916(3)(e): In any suit or judicial proceeding to recover from any person interested in the estate the amount of the tax apportioned to the person in accordance with this code, the determination of the court in this regard is prima facie correct.
Utah Code Annotated § 75-3-916(4): 
Utah Code Annotated § 75-3-916(4)(a): The fiduciary or other person required to pay the tax may withhold from any property of the decedent in his possession and distributable to any person interested in the estate, the amount of tax attributable to his interest. If the property in possession of the fiduciary or other person required to pay the tax and distributable to any person interested in the estate is insufficient to satisfy the proportionate amount of the tax determined to be due from the person, the fiduciary or other person required to pay the tax may recover the deficiency from the person interested in the estate. If the property is not in the possession of the fiduciary or other person required to pay the tax, the fiduciary or the other person required to pay the tax may recover from any person interested in the estate the amount of the tax apportioned to the person in accordance with this section.
Utah Code Annotated § 75-3-916(4)(b): If property held by the fiduciary or other person required to pay the tax is distributed prior to final apportionment of the tax, the fiduciary or other person may require the distributee to provide a bond or other security for the apportionment liability in the form and amount prescribed by the fiduciary, with the approval of the court having jurisdiction of the administration of the estate.
Utah Code Annotated § 75-3-916(5): (2)
Utah Code Annotated § 75-3-916(5)(a): In making an apportionment, allowances shall be made for any exemptions granted, any classification made of persons interested in the estate, and any deductions and credits allowed by the law imposing the tax.
Utah Code Annotated § 75-3-916(5)(b): Any exemption or deduction allowed by reason of the relationship of any person to the decedent or by reason of the purposes of the gift inures to the benefit of the person bearing that relationship or receiving the gift.  When an interest is subject to a prior present interest which is not allowable as a deduction, the tax apportionable against the present interest shall be paid from principal.
Utah Code Annotated § 75-3-916(5)(c): Any deduction for property previously taxed and any credit for gift taxes or death taxes of a foreign country paid by the decedent or his estate inures to the proportionate benefit of all persons liable to apportionment.
Utah Code Annotated § 75-3-916(5)(d): Any credit for inheritance, succession, or estate taxes or taxes of this nature in respect to property or interests includable in the estate inures to the benefit of the persons or interests chargeable with the payment of the tax to the extent that, or in proportion as, the credit reduces the tax.
Utah Code Annotated § 75-3-916(5)(e): (2) To the extent that property passing to or in trust for a surviving spouse or child or any charitable, public, or similar gift or bequest does not constitute an allowable deduction for purposes of the tax solely by reason of an inheritance tax or other death tax imposed upon and deductible from the property, the property shall not be included in the computation provided for in Subsection
Utah Code Annotated § 75-3-916(6): No interest in income and no estate for years or for life or other temporary interest in any property or fund is subject to apportionment as between the temporary interest and the remainder. The tax on the temporary interest and the tax, if any, on the remainder is chargeable against the corpus of the property or funds subject to the temporary interest and remainder.
Utah Code Annotated § 75-3-916(7): Neither the fiduciary nor other person required to pay the tax is under any duty to institute any suit or proceeding to recover from any person interested in the estate the amount of the tax apportioned to the person until the expiration of the three months next following final determination of the tax. A fiduciary or other person required to pay the tax who institutes the suit or proceeding within a reasonable time after the three months' period is not subject to any liability or surcharge because any portion of the tax apportioned to any person interested in the estate was collectible at a time following the death of the decedent but thereafter became uncollectible. If the fiduciary or other person required to pay the tax cannot collect from any person interested in the estate the amount of the tax apportioned to the person, the amount not recoverable shall be paid from the residuary estate. To the extent that the residuary estate is not adequate, the balance shall be equitably apportioned among the other persons interested in the estate who are subject to apportionment.
Utah Code Annotated § 75-3-916(8): Subject to this section, a fiduciary acting in another state or a person required to pay the tax who is domiciled in another state may institute an action in the courts of this state and may recover a proportionate amount of the federal estate tax, of an estate tax payable to another state, or of a death duty due by a decedent's estate to another state, from a person interested in the estate who is either domiciled in this state or who owns property in this state subject to attachment or execution. For the purposes of the action the determination of apportionment by the court having jurisdiction of the administration of the decedent's estate in the other state is prima facie correct. The provisions of this section apply only if the state in which the determination of apportionment was made affords a substantially similar remedy.
Utah Code Annotated § 75-3-916(9): This section does not apply to the apportionment of expenses incurred in connection with the determination of the amount and apportionment of the taxes due on account of the death of decedents dying prior to July 1, 1983.


Utah Code Annotated § 75-3-917 Certain formula clauses to be construed to refer to federal estate and generation-skipping transfer tax rules applicable to estates of decedents dying after December 31, 2009.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Utah Code Annotated § 75-3-917(1): (1) A will or trust of a decedent who dies after December 31, 2009 and before January 1, 2011, that contains a formula referring to the "unified credit," "estate tax exemption," "applicable exemption amount," "generation-skipping transfer tax exemption" or "GST exemption," or that measures a share of an estate or trust based on the amount that can pass free of federal estate or generation-skipping transfer taxes, or that is otherwise based on a similar provision of federal estate tax or generation-skipping transfer tax law, shall be considered to refer to the federal estate and generation-skipping transfer tax laws as they applied with respect to estates of decedents dying on December 31, 2009.
Utah Code Annotated § 75-3-917(1)(a): This provision may not apply with respect to a will or trust executed or amended after December 31, 2009, or that manifests an intent that a contrary rule shall apply if the decedent dies on a date on which there is no then-applicable federal estate or generation-skipping transfer tax.
Utah Code Annotated § 75-3-917(1)(b): (1) The reference to January 1, 2011 in Subsection
Utah Code Annotated § 75-3-917(2): (1) A proceeding to determine whether the decedent intended that the references under Subsection


Utah Code Annotated § 75-3-1001 Formal proceedings terminating administration -- Testate or intestate -- Order of general protection.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Utah Code Annotated § 75-3-1001(1): A personal representative or any interested person may petition for an order of complete settlement of the estate. The personal representative may petition at any time, and any other interested person may petition after one year from the appointment of the original personal representative except that no petition under this section may be entertained until the time for presenting claims which arose prior to the death of the decedent has expired. The petition may request the court to determine testacy, if not previously determined, to consider the final account or compel or approve an accounting and distribution, to construe any will or determine heirs, and to adjudicate the final settlement and distribution of the estate. After notice to all interested persons and hearing the court may enter an order or orders, on appropriate conditions, determining the persons entitled to distribution of the estate, and, as circumstances require, approving settlement and directing or approving distribution of the estate and discharging the personal representative from further claim or demand of any interested person.
Utah Code Annotated § 75-3-1001(2): If one or more heirs or devisees were omitted as parties in, or were not given notice of, a previous formal testacy proceeding, the court, on proper petition for an order of complete settlement of the estate under this section, and after notice to the omitted or unnotified persons and other interested parties determined to be interested on the assumption that the previous order concerning testacy is conclusive as to those given notice of the earlier proceeding, may determine testacy as it affects the omitted persons and confirm or alter the previous order of testacy as it affects all interested persons as appropriate in the light of the new proofs. In the absence of objection by an omitted or unnotified person, evidence received in the original testacy proceeding shall constitute prima facie proof of due execution of any will previously admitted to probate, or of the fact that the decedent left no valid will if the prior proceedings determined this fact.


Utah Code Annotated § 75-3-1002 Formal proceedings terminating testate administration -- Order construing will without adjudicating testacy.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
A personal representative administering an estate under an informally probated will or any devisee under an informally probated will may petition for an order of settlement of the estate which will not adjudicate the testacy status of the decedent. The personal representative may petition at any time, and a devisee may petition after one year from the appointment of the original personal representative, except that no petition under this section may be entertained until the time for presenting claims which arose prior to the death of the decedent has expired. The petition may request the court to consider the final account or compel or approve an accounting and distribution, to construe the will, and to adjudicate final settlement and distribution of the estate. After notice to all devisees and the personal representative and hearing, the court may enter an order or orders, on appropriate conditions, determining the persons entitled to distribution of the estate under the will, and, as circumstances require, approving settlement and directing or approving distribution of the estate and discharging the personal representative from further claim or demand of any devisee who is a party to the proceeding and those he represents. If it appears that a part of the estate is intestate, the proceedings shall be dismissed or amendments made to meet the provisions of Section

Utah Code Annotated § 75-3-1003 Closing estates -- By sworn statement of personal representative -- Waiver of accountings.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Utah Code Annotated § 75-3-1003(1): Unless prohibited by order of the court and except for estates being administered in supervised administration proceedings when all of the distributees of the estate consent in writing, a personal representative may close an estate by filing with the court no earlier than four months after the date of original appointment of a general personal representative for the estate, a verified statement stating that the personal representative, or a prior personal representative whom the personal representative has succeeded, has:
Utah Code Annotated § 75-3-1003(1)(a): determined that the time limitation for presentation of creditors' claims has expired;
Utah Code Annotated § 75-3-1003(1)(b): fully administered the estate of the decedent by making payment, settlement, or other disposition of all claims which were presented, expenses of administration and estate, inheritance and other death taxes, except as specified in the statement, and that the assets of the estate have been distributed to the persons entitled.  If any claims remain undischarged, the statement shall state whether the personal representative has distributed the estate subject to possible liability with the agreement of the distributees or it shall state in detail other arrangements which have been made to accommodate outstanding liabilities; and
Utah Code Annotated § 75-3-1003(1)(c): sent a copy of the statement to all distributees of the estate and to all creditors or other claimants of whom he is aware whose claims are neither paid nor barred and has furnished a full account in writing of his administration to the distributees whose interests are affected thereby.
Utah Code Annotated § 75-3-1003(2): If no proceedings involving the personal representative are pending in the court one year after the closing statement is filed, the appointment of the personal representative terminates.

Utah Code Annotated § 75-3-1004 Liability of distributees to claimants.
-----------------------------------------------------------------------
After assets of an estate have been distributed and subject to Section

Utah Code Annotated § 75-3-1005 Limitations on proceedings against personal representative.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Unless previously barred by adjudication and except as provided in the closing statement, the rights of successors and of creditors whose claims have not otherwise been barred against the personal representative for breach of fiduciary duty are barred unless a proceeding to assert the same is commenced within six months after the filing of the closing statement. The rights thus barred do not include rights to recover from a personal representative for fraud, misrepresentation, or inadequate disclosure related to the settlement of the decedent's estate.

Utah Code Annotated § 75-3-1006 Limitations on actions and proceedings against distributees.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Utah Code Annotated § 75-3-1006(1): Unless previously adjudicated in a formal testacy proceeding or in a proceeding settling the accounts of a personal representative or otherwise barred, the claim of any claimant to recover from a distributee who is liable to pay the claim, and the right of any heir or devisee or of a successor personal representative acting in their behalf, to recover property improperly distributed or the value thereof from any distributee is barred at the later of:
Utah Code Annotated § 75-3-1006(1)(a): as to a claim by a creditor of the decedent, one year after the decedent's death; and
Utah Code Annotated § 75-3-1006(1)(b): as to any other claimant and any heir or devisee, at the later of:

Utah Code Annotated § 75-3-1007 Certificate discharging liens securing fiduciary performance.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
After his appointment has terminated, the personal representative, his sureties, or any successor of either, upon the filing of a verified application showing, so far as is known by the applicant, that no action concerning the estate is pending in any court, is entitled to receive a certificate from the registrar that the personal representative appears to have fully administered the estate in question. The certificate evidences discharge of any lien on any property given to secure the obligation of the personal representative in lieu of bond or any surety but does not preclude action against the personal representative or the surety.

Utah Code Annotated § 75-3-1008 Subsequent administration.
----------------------------------------------------------
If other property of the estate is discovered after an estate has been settled and the personal representative discharged or after one year after a closing statement has been filed, the court upon petition of any interested person and upon notice as it directs may appoint the same or a successor personal representative to administer the subsequently-discovered estate. If a new appointment is made, unless the court orders otherwise, the provisions of this code apply as appropriate; but no claim previously barred may be asserted in the subsequent administration.

Utah Code Annotated § 75-3-1101 Effect of approval of agreements involving trusts, inalienable interests, or interests of third persons.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
A compromise of any controversy as to admission to probate of any instrument offered for formal probate as the will of a decedent, the construction, validity, or effect of any probated will, the rights or interests in the estate of the decedent, any successor, or the administration of the estate, if approved in a formal proceeding in the court for that purpose, is binding on all the parties thereto, including those unborn, unascertained, or who could not be located. An approved compromise is binding even though it may affect a trust or an inalienable interest.

A guardian's authority and responsibility terminates upon the death, resignation, or removal of the guardian or upon the minor's death, adoption, marriage, or attainment of majority, but termination does not affect his liability for prior acts nor his obligation to account for funds and assets of his ward. Resignation of a guardian does not terminate the guardianship until it has been approved by the court. A testamentary appointment under an informally probated will terminates if the will is later denied probate in a formal proceeding.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Utah Code Annotated § 75-5-211(1): The court where the ward resides has concurrent jurisdiction with the court which appointed the guardian, or in which acceptance of an appointment by will or written instrument was filed, over resignation, removal, accounting, and other proceedings relating to the guardianship.
Utah Code Annotated § 75-5-211(2): If the court located where the ward resides is not the court in which acceptance of appointment is filed, the court in which proceedings subsequent to appointment are commenced shall in all appropriate cases notify the other court, in this or another state, and after consultation with that court determine whether to retain jurisdiction or transfer the proceedings to the other court, whichever is in the best interest of the ward.  A copy of any order accepting a resignation or removing a guardian shall be sent to the court in which acceptance of appointment is filed.


Utah Code Annotated § 75-5-212 Resignation or removal proceedings.
------------------------------------------------------------------
Utah Code Annotated § 75-5-212(1): Any person interested in the welfare of a ward, or the ward, if 14 or more years of age, may petition for removal of a guardian on the ground that removal would be in the best interest of the ward. A guardian may petition for permission to resign. A petition for removal or for permission to resign may, but need not, include a request for appointment of a successor guardian.
Utah Code Annotated § 75-5-212(2): After notice and hearing on a petition for removal or for permission to resign, the court may terminate the guardianship and make any further order that may be appropriate.
Utah Code Annotated § 75-5-212(3): If, at any time in the proceeding, the court determines that the interests of the ward are, or may be, inadequately represented, it may appoint an attorney to represent the minor, giving consideration to the preference of the minor if the minor is 14 or more years of age.

Utah Code Annotated § 75-5-301(2): The spouse of a married incapacitated person may by will or written instrument appoint a guardian of the incapacitated person.  The appointment becomes effective when, after having given seven days' prior written notice of his intention to do so to the incapacitated person and to the person having his care or with whom he resides or to at least one adult relative in the nearest degree of kinship to the incapacitated person in which there is an adult, the guardian files acceptance of appointment in the court in which the will is informally or formally probated or the written instrument is filed.  An effective appointment by a spouse has priority over an appointment by a parent unless it is terminated by the denial of probate in formal proceedings.
Utah Code Annotated § 75-5-301(3): This state shall recognize a testamentary appointment effected by filing acceptance under a will probated at the testator's domicile in another state.
Utah Code Annotated § 75-5-301(4): On the filing with the court in which the will was probated or the written instrument was filed, of written objection to the appointment by the person for whom a testamentary or instrumental appointment of guardian has been made, the appointment is terminated.  An objection does not prevent appointment by the court in a proper proceeding of the nominee named by will or written instrument or any other suitable person upon an adjudication of incapacity in proceedings under the succeeding sections of this part.

No multiple-party account will be effective against an estate of a deceased party to transfer to a survivor sums needed to pay debts, taxes, and expenses of administration, including statutory allowances to the surviving spouse, minor children and dependent children, if other assets of the estate are insufficient.

No proceeding to assert this liability shall be commenced unless the personal representative has received a written demand by a surviving spouse, a creditor, or one acting for a minor or dependent child of the decedent; and no proceeding shall be commenced later than two years following the death of the decedent. Sums recovered by the personal representative shall be administered as part of the decedent's estate. This section shall not affect the right of a financial institution to make payment on multiple-party accounts according to the terms thereof or make it liable to the estate of a deceased party unless before payment the institution has been served with process in a proceeding by the personal representative.

Only individuals whose registration of a security shows sole ownership by one individual or multiple ownership by two or more with right of survivorship, rather than as tenants in common, may obtain registration in beneficiary form.

Utah Code Annotated § 75-6-308 Ownership on death of owner.

On death of a sole owner or the last to die of all multiple owners, ownership of securities registered in beneficiary form passes to the beneficiary or beneficiaries who survive all owners.  On proof of death of all owners and compliance with any applicable requirements of the registering entity, a security registered in beneficiary form may be reregistered in the name of the beneficiary or beneficiaries who survived the death of all owners.  Until division of the security after the death of all owners, multiple beneficiaries surviving the death of all owners hold their interests as tenants in common.  If no beneficiary survives the death of all owners, the security belongs to the estate of the deceased sole owner or the estate of the last to die of all multiple owners.

Utah Code Annotated § 75-6-309(1): A registering entity is not required to offer or to accept a request for security registration in beneficiary form.

Utah Code Annotated § 75-6-309(3)(b): this part; and
Utah Code Annotated § 75-6-309(3)(c): information provided to it by affidavit of the personal representative of the deceased owner, or by the surviving beneficiary or by the surviving beneficiary's representatives, or other information available to the registering entity.  The protections of this part do not extend to a reregistration or payment made after a registering entity has received written notice from any claimant to any interest in the security objecting to implementation of a registration in beneficiary form.  No other notice or other information available to the registering entity affects its right to protection under this part.

The terms and conditions so established may provide for proving death, avoiding or resolving any problems concerning fractional shares, designating primary and contingent beneficiaries, and substituting a named beneficiary's descendants to take the place of the named beneficiary in the event of the beneficiary's death. Substitution may be indicated by appending to the name of the primary beneficiary the letters LDPS, standing for "lineal descendants per stirpes."  This designation substitutes a deceased beneficiary's descendants who survive the owner for a beneficiary who fails to survive, the descendants to be identified and to share in accordance with the law of the beneficiary's domicile at the owner's death governing inheritance by descendants of an intestate.  Other forms of identifying beneficiaries who are to take on one or more contingencies, and rules for providing proofs and assurances needed to satisfy reasonable concerns by registering entities regarding conditions and identities relevant to accurate implementation of registrations in beneficiary form, may be contained in a registering entity's terms and conditions.
