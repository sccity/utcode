Utah Code Annotated § 80-2a-201 Rights of parents -- Children's rights -- Interest and responsibility of state.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Utah Code Annotated § 80-2a-201(1): (2); (7); (1)
Utah Code Annotated § 80-2a-201(1)(a): Under both the United States Constitution and the constitution of this state, a parent possesses a fundamental liberty interest in the care, custody, and management of the parent's children. A fundamentally fair process must be provided to parents if the state moves to challenge or interfere with parental rights. A governmental entity must support any actions or allegations made in opposition to the rights and desires of a parent regarding the parent's child by sufficient evidence to satisfy a parent's constitutional entitlement to heightened protection against government interference with the parent's fundamental rights and liberty interests and, concomitantly, the right of the child to be reared by the child's natural parent.
Utah Code Annotated § 80-2a-201(1)(b): The fundamental liberty interest of a parent concerning the care, custody, and management of the parent's child is recognized, protected, and does not cease to exist simply because a parent may fail to be a model parent or because the parent's child is placed in the temporary custody of the state. At all times, a parent retains a vital interest in preventing the irretrievable destruction of family life. Before an adjudication of unfitness, government action in relation to a parent and the parent's child may not exceed the least restrictive means or alternatives available to accomplish a compelling state interest. Until the state proves parental unfitness, and the child suffers, or is substantially likely to suffer, serious detriment as a result, the child and the child's parent share a vital interest in preventing erroneous termination of their natural relationship and the state cannot presume that a child and the child's parent are adversaries.
Utah Code Annotated § 80-2a-201(1)(c): It is in the best interest and welfare of a child to be raised under the care and supervision of the child's natural parents. A child's need for a normal family life in a permanent home, and for positive, nurturing family relationships is usually best met by the child's natural parents. Additionally, the integrity of the family unit and the right of a parent to conceive and raise the parent's child are constitutionally protected. The right of a fit, competent parent to raise the parent's child without undue government interference is a fundamental liberty interest that has long been protected by the laws and Constitution and is a fundamental public policy of this state.
Utah Code Annotated § 80-2a-201(1)(d): The state recognizes that:
Utah Code Annotated § 80-2a-201(1)(d)(i): a parent has the right, obligation, responsibility, and authority to raise, manage, train, educate, provide and care for, and reasonably discipline the parent's child; and
Utah Code Annotated § 80-2a-201(1)(d)(ii): the state's role is secondary and supportive to the primary role of a parent.
Utah Code Annotated § 80-2a-201(1)(e): It is the public policy of this state that:
Utah Code Annotated § 80-2a-201(1)(e)(i): a parent retains the fundamental right and duty to exercise primary control over the care, supervision, upbringing, and education of the parent's child;
Utah Code Annotated § 80-2a-201(1)(e)(ii): a parent retains the right to have contact with the parent's child when the child is placed outside of the parent's home, and parent-time should be ordered by a court so long as the contact is not contrary to the best interest of the child; and
Utah Code Annotated § 80-2a-201(1)(e)(iii): a child has the right to have contact with the child's sibling when the child is placed outside of the home and apart from the child's sibling, and sibling visits should be ordered by a court unless the contact would be contrary to the safety or well-being of the child.
Utah Code Annotated § 80-2a-201(1)(f): (2); (7); (1) Subsections
Utah Code Annotated § 80-2a-201(2): It is also the public policy of this state that children have the right to protection from abuse and neglect, and that the state retains a compelling interest in investigating, prosecuting, and punishing abuse and neglect. Therefore, the state, as parens patriae, has an interest in and responsibility to protect a child whose parent abuses the child or does not adequately provide for the child's welfare. There may be circumstances where a parent's conduct or condition is a substantial departure from the norm and the parent is unable or unwilling to render safe and proper parental care and protection. Under those circumstances, the state may take action for the welfare and protection of the parent's child.
Utah Code Annotated § 80-2a-201(3): When the division intervenes on behalf of an abused, neglected, or dependent child, the division shall take into account the child's need for protection from immediate harm and the extent to which the child's extended family may provide needed protection. Throughout the division's involvement, the division shall utilize the least intrusive and least restrictive means available to protect a child, in an effort to ensure that children are brought up in stable, permanent families, rather than in temporary foster placements under the supervision of the state.
Utah Code Annotated § 80-2a-201(4): Chapter 3, Abuse, Neglect, and Dependency Proceedings If circumstances within the family pose a threat to the child's immediate safety or welfare, the division may seek custody of the child for a planned, temporary period and place the child in a safe environment, subject to the requirements of this section and in accordance with
Utah Code Annotated § 80-2a-201(5): 80-2a-302 In determining and making reasonable efforts with regard to a child, under Section

Utah Code Annotated § 80-4-104(4)(a): The fundamental liberty interest of a parent concerning the care, custody, and management of the parent's child is recognized, protected, and does not cease to exist simply because:
Utah Code Annotated § 80-4-104(4)(a)(i): a parent may fail to be a model parent; or
Utah Code Annotated § 80-4-104(4)(a)(ii): the parent's child is placed in the temporary custody of the state.
Utah Code Annotated § 80-4-104(4)(b): The juvenile court should give serious consideration to the fundamental right of a parent to rear the parent's child, and concomitantly, of the right of the child to be reared by the child's natural parent.
Utah Code Annotated § 80-4-104(5): At all times, a parent retains a vital interest in preventing the irretrievable destruction of family life.
Utah Code Annotated § 80-4-104(6): Before an adjudication of unfitness, government action in relation to a parent and a parent's child may not exceed the least restrictive means or alternatives available to accomplish a compelling state interest.
Utah Code Annotated § 80-4-104(7): Until parental unfitness is established and the children suffer, or are substantially likely to suffer, serious detriment as a result, the child and the child's parent share a vital interest in preventing erroneous termination of their relationship and the juvenile court may not presume that a child and the child's parents are adversaries.
Utah Code Annotated § 80-4-104(8): It is in the best interest and welfare of a child to be raised under the care and supervision of the child's natural parents. A child's need for a normal family life in a permanent home, and for positive, nurturing family relationships is usually best met by the child's natural parents. Additionally, the integrity of the family unit and the right of parents to conceive and raise their children are constitutionally protected. For these reasons, the juvenile court should only transfer custody of a child from the child's natural parent for compelling reasons and when there is a jurisdictional basis to do so.
Utah Code Annotated § 80-4-104(9): The right of a fit, competent parent to raise the parent's child without undue government interference is a fundamental liberty interest that has long been protected by the laws and Constitution of this state and of the United States, and is a fundamental public policy of this state.
Utah Code Annotated § 80-4-104(10): 
Utah Code Annotated § 80-4-104(10)(a): The state recognizes that:
Utah Code Annotated § 80-4-104(10)(a)(i): a parent has the right, obligation, responsibility, and authority to raise, manage, train, educate, provide for, and reasonably discipline the parent's child; and
Utah Code Annotated § 80-4-104(10)(a)(ii): the state's role is secondary and supportive to the primary role of a parent.
Utah Code Annotated § 80-4-104(10)(b): It is the public policy of this state that a parent retain the fundamental right and duty to exercise primary control over the care, supervision, upbringing, and education of the parent's child.
Utah Code Annotated § 80-4-104(10)(c): The interests of the state favor preservation and not severance of natural familial bonds in situations where a positive, nurturing parent-child relationship can exist, including extended family association and support.
Utah Code Annotated § 80-4-104(11): This chapter provides a judicial process for voluntary and involuntary severance of the parent-child relationship, designed to safeguard the rights and interests of all parties concerned and promote their welfare and that of the state.
Utah Code Annotated § 80-4-104(12): 80-4-301; 80-3-302
Utah Code Annotated § 80-4-104(12)(a): Wherever possible, family life should be strengthened and preserved, but if a parent is found, by reason of the parent's conduct or condition, to be unfit or incompetent based upon any of the grounds for termination described in this part, the juvenile court shall then consider the welfare and best interest of the child of paramount importance in determining whether termination of parental rights shall be ordered.
Utah Code Annotated § 80-4-104(12)(b): 80-4-301; 80-3-302 In determining whether termination is in the best interest of the child, and in finding, based on the totality of the circumstances, that termination of parental rights, from the child's point of view, is strictly necessary to promote the child's best interest, the juvenile court shall consider, among other relevant factors, whether:
Utah Code Annotated § 80-4-104(12)(b)(i): 80-4-301 sufficient efforts were dedicated to reunification in accordance with Section
Utah Code Annotated § 80-4-104(12)(b)(ii): 80-3-302 pursuant to Section

Utah Code Annotated § 80-4-105(2): An order or decree entered under this chapter may not disentitle a child to any benefit due to the child from any third person, including any Indian tribe, agency, state, or the United States.
