If no bonds have been issued then all unpaid installments of assessments levied against any piece of property may be paid in their entirety prior to the date upon which they become due by paying the principal amount due and the interest accrued thereon to the date of payment.

Utah Code Annotated § 54-8-22 Bonds -- Issuance authorized -- Amount -- Interest -- Additional requirements.
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
After the expiration of 30 days from the date of the adoption of the resolution levying the assessments, the county legislative body may issue negotiable interest-bearing bonds in a principal amount not exceeding the unpaid balance of the assessments levied.  The bonds shall bear interest at not exceeding 7% per annum, payable semiannually or annually, and shall mature serially over a period not exceeding 20 years, but in no event shall such bonds extend over a longer period of time than the period of time over which such installments of special assessments are due and payable and 90 days thereafter.

The bonds shall be callable for redemption from the proceeds of any property sold for the nonpayment of special assessments but not otherwise unless the bonds on the face thereof provide for redemption prior to maturity, and the county legislative body may provide that the bonds shall be redeemable on any interest payment date or dates prior to maturity pursuant to such notice and at such premiums as it deems advisable.  The bonds shall be signed by the county executive and the chair of the county legislative body and shall be countersigned by the city recorder or the clerk of the board of the town trustees or the clerk of the county legislative body, whichever is applicable, and one of such signatures may be a facsimile signature.

**************************************************************************************

Utah Code Annotated § 54-22-101 Title -- Legislative findings.
--------------------------------------------------------------
Utah Code Annotated § 54-22-101(1): This chapter is known as the "Stray Current or Voltage Remediation Act."
Utah Code Annotated § 54-22-101(2): The Legislature finds that:
Utah Code Annotated § 54-22-101(2)(a): to protect livestock and livestock operations, it is necessary and appropriate to establish an actionable level of stray current and voltage that is safely below any level that is capable of harming livestock or adversely affecting the behavior, health, or productivity of livestock;
Utah Code Annotated § 54-22-101(2)(b): the efficient, effective, and safe generation, transmission, and distribution of electrical energy by electric entities is critical to the well-being of the citizens and the economy of the state;
Utah Code Annotated § 54-22-101(2)(c): permitting an electric entity to face liability based on a level of stray current or voltage that is incapable of adversely affecting livestock seriously threatens the efficient, effective, and safe generation, transmission, and distribution of electrical energy in the state, as well as the continuing viability of economic activity that depends on electrical energy;
Utah Code Annotated § 54-22-101(2)(d): to guarantee the sufficient availability of efficient, effective, and safe electrical energy in the state, which requires the continuing operation of electric entities, it is necessary and appropriate for the Legislature to establish a uniform actionable level for an electric entity with respect to stray current and voltage and livestock; and
Utah Code Annotated § 54-22-101(2)(e): because the actionable level is set sufficiently below any level that is capable of adversely affecting the behavior, health, or productivity of livestock, any potential of harm to livestock from stray current or voltage below this level is highly remote and unexpected.
