This chapter is known as the "Utah Housing Corporation Act."

Utah Code Annotated § 63H-8-102 Policy -- Finding and declaration.
------------------------------------------------------------------
Utah Code Annotated § 63H-8-102(1): The Legislature declares that the policy of the state is to assure the health, safety, and welfare of its citizens, that an adequate supply of decent, safe, and sanitary housing is essential to the well-being of the citizens of the state, and that an adequate supply of mortgage funds for housing at reasonable interest rates is in the public interest.
Utah Code Annotated § 63H-8-102(2): The Legislature finds and declares that:
Utah Code Annotated § 63H-8-102(2)(a): there continues to exist throughout the state a seriously inadequate supply of safe and sanitary dwelling accommodations within the financial means of persons and families of low or moderate income who wish to purchase or rent residential housing;
Utah Code Annotated § 63H-8-102(2)(b): from time to time the high rates of interest charged by mortgage lenders seriously restrict the transfer of existing housing and new housing starts;
Utah Code Annotated § 63H-8-102(2)(c): the reduction in residential construction starts associated with the high rates causes a condition of substantial unemployment and underemployment in the construction industry which impedes the economy of the state and affects the welfare and prosperity of all the people of the state;
Utah Code Annotated § 63H-8-102(2)(d): these conditions associated with the recurrent shortages of residential mortgage funds contribute to slums and blight in the cities and rural areas of the state and ultimately to the deterioration of the quality of living conditions within the state;
Utah Code Annotated § 63H-8-102(2)(e): in accordance with the purpose of this chapter to assist in providing housing for low and moderate income persons who otherwise could not achieve decent, safe, and sanitary housing, the corporation shall make every effort to make housing available in rural, inner city, and other areas experiencing difficulty in securing construction and mortgage loans, and to make decent, safe, and sanitary housing available to low income persons and families;
Utah Code Annotated § 63H-8-102(2)(f): in order to assure an adequate supply of private capital for this housing, the cooperation between private enterprise and state government is essential and is in the public interest;
Utah Code Annotated § 63H-8-102(2)(g): low and moderate income persons in Utah have a wide range of housing needs, which necessitates the development of many different kinds of programs to address those needs, including programs providing mortgage loans, nontraditional loans, grants, and other forms of financial assistance, and combinations of these forms;
Utah Code Annotated § 63H-8-102(2)(h): there are private organizations and governmental entities throughout Utah that are endeavoring to improve the availability of housing for low and moderate income persons and families, but many of these organizations and entities lack expertise and financial resources to act efficiently and expeditiously in these efforts;
Utah Code Annotated § 63H-8-102(2)(i): innovative programs that bring together resources from the public, nonprofit, and private sector are necessary in order to increase the supply of housing for low and moderate income persons and families, but these programs usually need advice and financial assistance to become established;
Utah Code Annotated § 63H-8-102(2)(j): all of the foregoing are public purposes and uses for which money may be borrowed, expended, advanced, loaned, or granted, and that these activities serve a public purpose in improving or otherwise benefiting the people of this state, and that the necessity of enacting the provisions in this chapter is in the public interest and is so declared as a matter of express legislative determination; and
Utah Code Annotated § 63H-8-102(2)(k): the compelling need within the state for the creation of an adequate supply of mortgage funds at reasonable interest rates and for other kinds of financial assistance to help provide affordable housing for low and moderate income individuals can be best met by the establishment of an independent body corporate and politic, constituting a public corporation, vested with the powers and duties specified in this chapter.
Utah Code Annotated § 63H-8-102(3): The Legislature declares that the corporation is intended to operate:
Utah Code Annotated § 63H-8-102(3)(a): with the power to issue tax exempt bonds to finance the purchase of mortgage loans to qualified buyers;
Utah Code Annotated § 63H-8-102(3)(b): as a financially independent body; and
